Write a program to find the siblings of the given integer array, if no siblings found then return -1. input1 refers to the length of the input. input2 is the values and input3 is the value for which we need to find the siblings.

Example 1

Input1: 5

Input2: 1,2,3,4,5

Input3: 1

output: (-1)

Explanation: As 1 is the root element which wont have any siblings so return value is -1.

Example2:

input1: 6

Input2: 1,2,3,4,5,6

input3: 5

output: (4,6)

Explanation: (2,3) are the children of 1 and (4,5,6) are the children of (2,3) so the output is (4,6)
